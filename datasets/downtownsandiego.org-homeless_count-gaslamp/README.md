# Homeless Counts in Gaslamp District, San Diego

Since 2014, the Downtown San Diego Partnership has been conducting monthly
counts of the homeless in the Downtown neighborhood. The positions of homeless
sleepers are recorded on paper maps, which are compiled into a spreadsheet. The
San Diego Regional Data Library is running a project to digitize these paper
maps](https://downtown-homelesness.sandiegodata.org/) into geographic datasets.

This dataset covers only the Gaslamp district, from 2014-01-01 to 2018-06-28. 

The data were digitized by students of Corri-Anne Burgess at Kearney Senior
High as a year-end class project. The digitization procedure involved
estimateing the positions of each point from a PDF scan of the each map,
placing the digitized point on a map in a web form. Although the procedure is
less accurate that traditional digitization points, spot checking suggests the
additional digitization error is much less than the positional error of the
original data collection and recording, and the result is suficient to place
each point to a parcel.


## Corrections

Corrections made during wranging include: 

* One point for map 42 was given the incorrect date of 2019-05-26, which was corrected to 2017005-26
* The value "individual_sleeper" was shortened to 'ind'
* In the rain column, the value 'na' was replaced with blanks.
