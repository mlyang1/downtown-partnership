# Pedestrian Density By Block and Time

This datasets aggregates the ``cityiq.io-pedestrians-san_diego`` dataset by
census block, time of day and day of week. The time of day is represented as:

* morning: 6:00 to 11:00
* lunch: 11:00 to 13:00
* afternoon: 13:00 to 15:00
* evening: 17:00 to 22:00
* ni22ght: 22:00 to 6:00

Pedestrian densities are in terms of the average of the pedestrians per hour
for the walkways in a block, but the density value should only be used as a
relative value.
