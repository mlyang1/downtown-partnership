## Counting Downtown San Diego Homeless

For the last 7 years, the [Downtown San Diego
Partnership](https://downtownsandiego.org/) has been conducting monthly counts
of homeless in the Downtown neighborhood. The data is recorded on paper maps,
which are [compiled into a
spreadsheet.](https://downtownsandiego.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/January-20
19-Unsheltered-Homeless-Sleep-Count-Web-Version-Final-003.pdf) This is a
fantastic dataset which would be even more useful if the hand-recorded paper
maps were digitized.

This project involves collecting and digitizing 5 years of the monthly maps, to
produce a geographic dataset, whcih we will analyze for time trends and for the
association between homless movements, geography and the built environment.

The data has been collected and organized, and now we need volunteers to
georeference the maps and digitize them to produce gepgraphic datasets that we
can combine into a single dataset.

Here is one of the maps that we will digitize:

This project will involve:
* Extracting images for each of the neighborhood maps for each month.
* Geo-referencing the images in QGIS
* Digitizing each of the count locations
* Combining all of the digitized datasets into a single combined dataset.
* Analyzing the combined data.


When the project is complete, we will have a monthly, geographically precise
accounting for the 500 to 1000 homeless people in the Downtown neighborhood,
about 20% of all unsheltered homeless in the county.

All of the maps for this project are [online in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kRxyu-pfx20NjpD8-vfHFb9h4hgWMkws?usp=sharing)

# Sub Projects

* A student group at theKearney High School of Science, Connections and Technology are spending the end of the year digitizing and analyzing a few of the neighborhoods. 
* We'll be building a web application to digitize the rest of the maps. [See the draft specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CP0AtmKOrtUQ7Ius6nbSMeclmggZyfCt0F1lz56Ih-A/edit?usp=sharing) for an overview of the application.
